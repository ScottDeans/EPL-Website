#Database

Currently, .../config/database.php is pointing at a database called CMPT395_hucatog, with the standard CS50 username and password (jharvard and crimson, respectively). To add this database, navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser, log in using the standard CS50 username and password, then navigate to "Databases" and create one named "CMPT395_hucatog".
