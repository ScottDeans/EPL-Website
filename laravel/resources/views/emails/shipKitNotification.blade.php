Good morning,

This is an automated reminder that kit {!! $key->barcode !!} must be shipped to branch {!! $key->branch_code !!} ({!! $key->branch_name !!}) <i><b>today</b></i> in order to satisfy a scheduled booking. Please ensure that one of the staff members at your branch ships the kit and updates its status via the "Transfers" tab on the Kit Management App.

Thank you, and have a nice day!
